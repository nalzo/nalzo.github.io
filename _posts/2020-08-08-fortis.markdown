```
Standing on the precipice
Buffeted by the winds
Waves crashing on the rough boulders below
Storm clouds gathering above
I take refuge in perseverance

Worn out by the weather
and the passage of seasons
A rough hewn rock smoothened
Bested by neither erosion nor time
I take solace in endurance
 
Tossed about on life's angry waters
Blown around by violent winds
Adrift on this mighty ocean
Betrayed by her treacherous depths
I take gratitude in valor

I face life's many arrows
With the sword of determination
The shield of patience 
And the spear of courage

Strength of mind if not strong of body
To bend but neither break nor bow
To live each day to its very fullest
Giving thanks for all I have [and love]
```
