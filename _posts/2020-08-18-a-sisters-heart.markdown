<!-- Written during a text excahnge with my sister about being absent for my niece's wedding during covid-19-->

```
A Sisters Heart! 

Standing on the sidelines 
Watching you from afar
My heart is there 
My body absent 
Safety in solitude

Your big day 
You celebrate 
My mind’s eye sees your feelings 
While I watch events zoom by
Safety in solitude

As the priest chants the prayers
As your baby sits on a swing
As she is joined in marriage 
May only joy prevail
Safety in solitude 

I feel your big heart beating
For everyone you love
You never miss an occasion
You’re always there by my side
Safety in solitude

May all your wishes be granted
May all your dreams come true
May you be forever happy
May you always be loved
Safety in solitude 
```
